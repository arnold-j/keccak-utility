### Summary of the Entire File

This C++ file(s) implements an optimized Ethereum address derivation utility within the `eth` namespace, designed for high-performance scenarios. It includes functions for converting between byte vectors and hexadecimal strings, applying EIP-55 checksum encoding, deriving Ethereum addresses from public keys, parsing command-line inputs, and deriving multiple addresses in parallel. The implementation minimizes dynamic memory allocation by using fixed-size buffers, optimizes hex conversion loops with pointer arithmetic and lookup tables, performs in-place transformations where possible, reuses cryptographic contexts, and supports parallelization for batch processing. The code leverages modern C++ features such as `std::string_view`, `constexpr`, and `std::atomic`, and includes robust error handling with `std::runtime_error`. The main function demonstrates both single and parallel address derivation, making it suitable for integration into larger systems requiring high throughput.

The file includes necessary headers for I/O, containers, exceptions, character handling, algorithms, threading, and the Crypto++ library for Keccak-256 hashing. The `eth` namespace encapsulates all functionality, using `Byte` as an alias for `unsigned char` for clarity. The design avoids unnecessary dynamic allocations by using pre-allocated buffers, optimizes performance with pointer-based operations, and ensures thread safety in parallel operations using atomic counters. The implementation is optimized for strenuous loads, with each function designed to minimize overhead and maximize efficiency, while maintaining readability and maintainability through clear documentation and modern C++ practices.

The main function provides a practical example of using the utility, parsing a public key from command-line arguments or using default test data, deriving a single address, and demonstrating parallel derivation for multiple addresses. The parallel derivation uses a thread pool with atomic indexing to distribute work efficiently across available hardware threads. Error handling is consistent, with exceptions caught and reported to `std::cerr`, ensuring robust operation. The code is well-suited for high-performance Ethereum address derivation tasks, balancing efficiency, safety, and usability.

### Function Summaries

**`bytesToHex`**: This function converts a vector of bytes to a hexadecimal string using a pre-allocated buffer, eliminating dynamic memory allocation overhead. It uses a `constexpr` array of hex digits for efficient lookup and employs pointer arithmetic to write directly into the buffer, ensuring optimal performance. The function is marked `noexcept` as it does not throw exceptions, making it suitable for high-performance scenarios, and null-terminates the output for compatibility with C-style strings.

**`hexToBytes`**: This function parses a hexadecimal string into a vector of bytes, using a `constexpr` lookup table to avoid branching during conversion. It validates the input length and characters, throwing `std::runtime_error` for invalid inputs, and reserves vector capacity to minimize reallocations. The implementation uses pointer-based access to the input string for efficiency, making it suitable for high-throughput parsing tasks.

**`toEIP55Address`**: This function applies EIP-55 checksum encoding to an Ethereum address in-place, using a reusable `CryptoPP::Keccak_256` object to minimize hash object construction overhead. It creates a lowercase copy of the address for hashing, then modifies the original buffer based on hash nibbles, avoiding unnecessary string copies. The function validates the address format and throws `std::runtime_error` for invalid inputs, ensuring robust operation in performance-critical scenarios.

**`deriveEthereumAddress`**: This function derives an Ethereum address from an uncompressed public key, storing the result in a pre-allocated buffer and reusing a `CryptoPP::Keccak_256` object. It validates the public key size, computes the Keccak-256 hash, extracts the last 20 bytes, converts them to hex, and applies EIP-55 checksum encoding, all with minimal allocations. The function throws `std::runtime_error` for invalid inputs, making it efficient and safe for high-load address derivation tasks.

**`parsePublicKey`**: This function parses command-line arguments to obtain a public key, either from a hex string input or default test data. It validates the input length, uses `hexToBytes` for conversion, and throws `std::runtime_error` for invalid inputs. The function minimizes allocations by reserving vector capacity and using `std::string_view` for input, making it efficient for command-line parsing in performance-sensitive applications.

**`deriveMultipleAddresses`**: This function derives multiple Ethereum addresses in parallel, distributing work across available hardware threads using an atomic index counter. It validates input sizes, uses thread-local `CryptoPP::Keccak_256` objects to avoid contention, and stores results in pre-allocated buffers, minimizing allocations and ensuring thread safety. The function throws `std::runtime_error` for mismatched inputs, making it suitable for high-throughput batch processing in multi-threaded environments.
